# Data_Analysis

**Data** Data is the collection of facts(number, picture).

**Data Analysis** is the collection, organization and transformation of the data in order to draw the conclusion, make predictions and drive informed decision making.

**Data Analyst** is the person responsible for the data analysis to support the data driven decision management. A data analyst is an explorer, a detective, and an artist all rolled into one. Analytics is the quest for inspiration.

**Data Ecosystems** Data ecosystems are made up of various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data. These elements include hardware and software tools, and the people who use them. A technical mindset involves the ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way. Data strategy is the management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis.

**Thinking Analytically** Analytical thinking involves identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner. Gap analysis lets you examine and evaluate how a process works currently in order to get where you want to be in the future. Use 5 WHY?

# SQL (Structured Query Language)

Pronounced as "sequel".

**Query** A query is a request for data or information from a database.
**Syntax** Every programming language, including SQL, follows a unique set of guidelines known as syntax. 
The syntax of every SQL query is the same: 

- Use __SELECT__ to choose the columns you want to return.

- Use __FROM__ to choose the tables where the columns you want are located.

- Use __WHERE__ to filter for certain information.

For example, if you are looking for a specific customer with the last name Chavez, the WHERE clause would be: 

WHERE field1 = 'Chavez'

However, if you are looking for all customers with a last name that begins with the letters â€œCh," the WHERE clause would be:

WHERE field1 LIKE 'Ch%'

You can conclude that the LIKE clause is very powerful because it allows you to tell the database to look for a certain pattern! The percent sign % is used as a wildcard to match one or more characters. In the example above, both Chavez and Chen would be returned. Note that in some databases an asterisk * is used as the wildcard instead of a percent sign %.

**Comments**: In these cases, you can place comments alongside your SQL to help you remember what the name represents. Comments are text placed between certain characters, /* and */, or after two dashes --), like:
**Aliases**: 

**Note**: SQL queries use SELECT, FROM, and WHERE to specify the data to be returned from the query. Capitalization, indentation, and semicolons are useful for making your SQL queries easier to read. In addition, comments can be added to explain queries to others. As you progress through this course, you will continue discovering many ways in which SQL can be a very powerful tool for retrieving, analyzing, and interpreting data.

# Visualization software (Tableau)
__Tableau__ is a popular data visualization tool that lets you pull data from nearly any system and turn it into compelling visuals or actionable insights.
